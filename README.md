# String-Algorims-Dynamic-Programming-Multithreading
In this body of work, we implement String Searching algorithms including the Naive Algorithm, the Boyer Moore algorithm, and the KMP algorithm. We then implement Dynamic Programming solutions to solve the Knapsack Problem, and the Longest Common Subsequence. We finally implement some multithreading matrix multiplication for a 100x100 matrix.
